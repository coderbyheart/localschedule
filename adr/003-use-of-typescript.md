# ADR 003: use of TypeScript

This project is developed using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (a
typed superset of JavaScript).

JavaScript is the most popular language according to the
[2019 Stack Overflow survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#technology)
and it is therefore likely that many developers using the project will be
familiar with the language concepts and how to use and run it.

Virtually all cloud providers provide their SDKs in JavaScript or TypeScript
which this project can integrate natively.
